# CasinoProject
Another project I made for AP CSA. Couple little gambling games and some other bits of functionality.

Gives you 100 dollars to start with and allows you to play two different games, Mines and Dice (based on the Stake.com games) to get more. Also allows you to check your balance, see your win/loss record, and quit the program. No GUI, everything happens in the console.
