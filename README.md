# CasinoProject
Another project I made for AP CSA. Couple little gambling games and some other bits of functionality.

Gives you 100 dollars to start with and allows you to play two different games, Mines (known in the files as "Gems") and Dice to get more. Both of the playable games are based on versions from Stake.com. Also allows you to check your balance, see your win/loss record, and quit the program. No GUI, everything happens in the console.

Note: This program is very insecure, AKA there's almost 0 error handling. Users are free to input out of bounds integers, negative integers, strings, and any other assortment of error-causing inputs. Due dates happen and the idea of going through everything implementing error handling on my own time sounded kind of boring. Maybe I'll come back some day and deal with all the error handling, but don't get your hopes up.
